# Windows Server 2012R2, 2016, 2019, 2022: Configuring Additional IP

Adding additional IP addresses on a [Windows server](https://contabo.com/en/windows-servers-vps/) is very easy compared to Linux operating systems. 
To get started, search for **“Control Panel”** in the Windows search bar.

After opening the Control Panel select **“Network and Internet”**.

Now navigate to the **“Network and Sharing Center”**.

Select the connection type which is **“Ethernet”** in this case.

A window with your Ethernet Status will pop up. Here you can see the general status of your server’s connection. Continue by clicking on **“Properties”**:

Again, another window with your server’s IPv4 properties will open. Here you can see your main IP address, as well as your subnet mask, the default gateway etc. Click on **“Advanced“**:

Another window with the **“Advanced TCP/IP settings”** will open. This is the menu where you can add your additional IP address by clicking on **“Add”** under the **“IP addresses”** section:
