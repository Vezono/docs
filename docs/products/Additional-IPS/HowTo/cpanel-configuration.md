# cPanel: Configuring Additional IP

Adding additional IP addresses in [cPanel](https://contabo.com/en/cpanel-servers/) is very easy. There is no need to deal with configuration files. 
Log in to [WHM (Web Host Manager)](https://contabo.com/blog/cpanelwhm-practices/) by entering your IP address and the Port of cPanel which is usually 2087. 
Example: **http://YourIPAddress:2087**. If you are a Contabo customer, you will get an email with your login data and a direct link to your control panel:

After logging yourself in into the cPanel/WHM Dashboard, use the search bar on the left to search for **“IP Functions”** and select **“Add a New IP Address”**.

A menu will appear, where you can add your additional IP address and select the subnet mask. *If you are a Contabo customer*, you will find all necessary values in the email Contabo sent you. 
*Otherwise* contact your provider regarding your additional IP address.
